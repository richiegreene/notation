# Notation
Intended as a browser-based resource for microtonal musicians interested in learning, understanding, and converting exsisitnng equal tempered and just intonated notational practices. The app converts ratios to HEJI notation (via the enormous assistance of [HEJI CALC](https://github.com/PLAINSOUND/hejicalc)) and expands on it from the 47-limit to 89-limit via my [custom designed accidentals.](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Richie%27s_HEJI_extensions).

# Notation
## https://richiegreene.github.io/notation/
Browser-based resource for microtonal music notational. The app converts ratios to HEJI notation (via the enormous assistance of [HEJI CALC](https://github.com/PLAINSOUND/hejicalc)) and expands on it from the 47-limit to 89-limit via my [custom designed accidentals.](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Richie%27s_HEJI_extensions).

Browser-based resource for microtonal music notation. Converting ratios to [HEJI notation](https://masa.plainsound.org/pdfs/notation.pdf) (via adopting the process of [HEJI CALC](https://github.com/PLAINSOUND/hejicalc)) and expands on it from the 47-limit to 89-limit via my personal [custom designed accidentals.](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Richie%27s_HEJI_extensions).

I would like to create a new region (sortable.js window) in this app named "Chord Entry" that is somewhat similar to the existing "Interval Entry", including the sortable layout, toggle switch which only allows one of the entry fields to be selected at a time, and load/clear button beneath the (base freq) ratio.

this entry space should look like:

[ ] Chord Entry
[base freq n] [entry field allowing enumerated ratios]
[base freq d]
[load][clear]

when this field is active, the corresponding Output region of this app should reflect this notation by allowing consecutive letter names and accidentals to appear allow with the corresponding cent deviation, Hz, and cents from refference to appear directly under each, as though each note of a "chord" creates a collumn from low to high.

Ideal design and example with C4 as the default defined 1/1 reference:
 ___________________
|[x] Chord Entry    |
|                   |
|[1] [4:5:6]        |
|[1]                |
|___________________|

 ______________________________
|Output                        |
|                              |          
|[ ] normalise                 |
|Cn      | Em       | Gn       |
|4       : 5        : 6        |
|Cj ±0.0 | Ej -13.7 | Gj +2.0  |
|261.6 Hz| 327.0 Hz | 392.4 Hz |
|0.0c    | +386.3c  | +702.0c  |
|______________________________|

*Note* the use of "|" is for demonstrative "Column" purposes and window-design only and should not be visually present, however ":" should so to indicate the enumerated ratio displayed above.

--- Additional clarification on enumerated ratios ---

for assistance on how to interpret enumerated ratios into a a string of HEJI note names:

if base freq = n/d
and chord = a:b:c: ...

find common denominator of a:bc:...

multiply each of those ratios by n/d

ex: base freq = 5/6
chord = 4:5:6

HEJI Output displays the note names for the three ratios 5/6, 25/24, and 5/4

--- Cautious clarification ---

Perhaps most demanding of this update will be formatting the Output window. Note that currently the app goes to great lengths to align different fonts to accurately depict a single note output. With this in mind I invite creative solutions to generatively expand on the existing leg work, so that the user may enter near endless "Chord lengths" (a:b:c:...:z) which expand the width of the output window and depict both the appropriate note names/accidentals and underlying deviation information.

--- Building in Steps ---

As this is a significant update, I would like to take this in small stages, checking in with my assistances bit by bit. With I propose the order of these changes to be the following, requiring my approval between each checkpoint:

 - Redesigning the Output window so that is displays a "Mirrored" second instance the current entry readout. This duplicate readout process should be scalable to potentially allow for chord/harmonic output. 
 
 - create a changing/scaling number of readouts in output, set via a number entry field/etc to troubleshoot and test the expandable Output window when seeing many simultaneous output instances

 - Building the final Chord Entry field/window which sends its info to the scaling output window

To hold us to this 3 step goal I am archiving this plan within the directory as a file named "Staging Chord Entry"

Please now proceed with step one, to implement a "Mirrored" second instance of the resulting ratio-to-note-name read out in the output window which is presented just to the right, within the same window.
